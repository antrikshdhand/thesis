From August to November 2024, all my thesis work was conducted on the Thales Alienware A51 laptop in a folder called `acml_2024_s2`. At the start of November, as I was lost in regards to the direction of my thesis, I decided to start fresh, and so made this GitHub repository `thesis-ml`. I slowly started transferring files from `acml_2024_s2` to `thesis-ml` while rewriting a lot of code and maintaining a high level of function documentation. 

Most files were superseeded by a better version which you can find in the parent directory of this folder, `thesis-ml/ml/main`. Some files were not transferred over at all. 

My last day at Thales is the 13th of December, requiring me to hand over the Alienware laptop. For completeness, and for archival purposes, I have transferred over all the files from the `acml_2024_s2` folder which were not directly superseeded into this `archive` folder.

As I look back on my work, some of the preliminary results are actually quite interesting (see the denoising files for instance).
