multiple_recordings.m : Outputs spectrograms for those vessels which have 
multiple unique recordings (different dates) associated with them.
The output of multiple_recordings.m is the folder `spectrograms` (folders 
were flattened).
The inner loop of `multiple_recordings.m` was limited to 1000, which means not 
all vessels which could have been exported were exported. This leaves us with 
2684 spectrograms.
`ships_with_multiple_recordings.csv` is the output from the helper script
`organise_pairs.py` which can be found in the DATASET_CSVS directory. This
csv is used by multiple_recordings.m
